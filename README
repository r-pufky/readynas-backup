ReadyNAS Backup Scripts
-----------------------
These were a collection of scripts I wrote to overcome the restricted backup
functionality provided by the backup web-face on the ReadyNAS.  Any questions or
comments, please let me know!  More information, and updated versions can be
found at:

1) If you have never run cronjob tasks before, or not comfortable with using the
   commandline, STOP NOW.  These scripts are fore more advanced users who want
   more control over their backups.

2) Read the scripts and the cronjob file and verify they are setup the way you
   want them.  Please note the generation of public key authentication for the
   NAS, and also note that as of this release, the ReadyNAS was affected by the
   openssl bug.  If you don't want to use a script, you can just remove it from
   the cronjobs file, and delete the script.
   
3) Prep the ReadyNAS for backup scripts:

   - Install SSH Addons if they are not installed already.  They are located
     here:

     You want to select your current ReadyNAS firmware version, then download 
     and install the following packages:
   
       ToggleSSH
       EnableRootSSH
   
   - Create a backup share, only allowing READ access to normal users.  I named
     my backup share "Backup"
     
4) Copy the script to the root directory on your NAS; the command would be
   something like the following:
   
   scp -r ReadyNAS-Backup-Scripts/ root@YOURNAS:/root/

5) SSH to your box to verify the setup.  I would recommend logging into your NAS
   and verifying your scripts are working as intended by first running the
   scripts with the --check and --log options:
   
     ./[script]_backup --check --log
   
   After that, run the initial backup with that script.  Please note that the
   first actual backup of data will take the longest.  You should probably run 
   the first backup with --log to make sure everything goes well:
   
     ./[script]_backup --log

6) Install your cronjob, and go.

   crontab /root/cronjobs
